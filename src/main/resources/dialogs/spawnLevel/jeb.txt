Jeb: Howdy partner! Don't you just love nature?
The open plains, swamps, rivers... I just love 'em all!

Jeb: Want to know a secret?
I know about a hidden jewel that belongs to the gatekeeper's family. They hid it somewhere around here.
They don't know 'bout that but, I found it a couple weeks back while I was sneakin' through the bush on a hunt.
I can tell you 'bout where it at for a price.
