I heard there is a guy who lives around here hiding a treasure.
They say it is the strongest weapon ever created!! Scary to think something that powerful is in Townsville.

They say the weapon is at least 2000 years old! And there are records kept on its previous owners throughout that time.
Legend has it the person who owns it can never keep it in his possession for more than a year or too before something happens. Crazy!!
